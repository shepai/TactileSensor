# TactileSensor
Development of a soft tactile sensors using pressure resistors and soft padding. Ater the development of software fr controlling <a href="https://github.com/shepai/RoboSkin">high resolution tactile sensors</a> we evaluated the performance of low resolution tactile sensors. These devices are cheaper to manufacture than high resolution sensors, and for feet tasks the resolution difference makes little difference.
