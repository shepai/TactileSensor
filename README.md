# TactileSensor

This repository focuses on the development of soft tactile sensors utilizing pressure resistors and soft padding. The project follows the successful development of software for controlling [high-resolution tactile sensors](https://github.com/shepai/RoboSkin).

## Overview

Low-resolution tactile sensors have been evaluated for performance, offering a cost-effective alternative to their high-resolution counterparts. Specifically designed for tasks involving feet, where the resolution difference has minimal impact, these sensors present an economical and practical solution.

## Project Structure

- **/code**: Holds the source code for the software controlling the low-resolution tactile sensors.
- **/assets**: Contains documentation related to the 3d print, laser cut and PCB files used
